???

 - This is, right?
 - It's more than a work board. It's a way of doing our work.

# What is Kanban?

--

 - Kanban is a Japaneese manufacuturing method, pioneered by Toyota in the 40's.

--

 - Literally translates to "visual sign" or "card".

???

- [Toyota line-workers used a kanban (i.e., an actual card) to signal steps in their manufacturing process. The systemâ€™s highly visual nature allowed teams to communicate more easily on what work needed to be done and when. It also standardized cues and refined processes, which helped to reduce waste and maximize value.][LeanKitKanban]

 - Inventory Manaagmenet System
--
 - When a worker runs out of a part, they send a kanban (card) back up stream to signal they need more.

???

- We use a Kanban system at our factory. When assembly needs more parts, they send a physical kanban card up the supply chain as a signal to send more.

--
 - Kanban is a ***pull*** system.

???

 - Instead of pushing work through the system, creating bottle necks, inventory is always *requested*. Never pushed.

This is all well and good, but...

# What does this have to do with software?

So we can use inventory management techniques to optimize the flow of inventory through our system.
