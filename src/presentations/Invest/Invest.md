# INVEST 
## In Our User Stories

---

class: center, middle

> As a user,
> I want stuff,
> so that I can do things.

---

## User stories should:

 - *Tell a story*
 - Make it clear what the value is
 - And who it benefits
 - Be comprised of the smallest deliverable functionality

How can we achieve that?

---

## INVEST

 - Independent
 - Negotiable
 - Valuable
 - Estimatable
 - Small
 - Testable

---

## Independent

 - Self contained with no dependencies on other stories.
 - Not always possible, but it's much easier to re-prioritize if they are.
 - Try to find ways to break the dependencies.
 - If that's not possible, consider lumping them together.

---

## Negotiable

 - In both priority and scope

> Jim, the gamer, wants a green icon
> when the battery is > 20% and a red
> icon when the battery is <= 20%,
> so he doesn't kill his phone and miss calls.

---

## Valuable

- Each story should deliver some piece of valuable functionality to our users.
- If the story doesn't provide value on it's own:
 - Should it be done at all?
 - Is it really a task that enables a different story?
- No story should read "As a system..."
- Users don't want database tables or web service endpoints.

---

## Estimatable

 - If there's not enough information to estimate the story, then there's not enough information to implement it.

---

## Small

 - Most stories should be completable within a few days.
 - Every story should be completable within an iteration.
 - Stories bigger than that should be broken down further.

---

## Testable

 - Each story should have an acceptance criteria
 - Without a test to say "this is done", how do we know it's done?
 - If it can't be tested, the story is too vague and/or too large, so it's not ready to implement.

## What's wrong here?

> As a user,
> I want a green icon
> when the battery is > 20%
> and a red icon when the battery is <= 20%

## What's wrong here?

> As a user,
> I want a green icon
> when the battery is > 20%
> and a red icon when the battery is <= 20%

 - Who is the user?
 - Why does the user want this functionality?
 - What is the user's problem?
 - How can we be sure this will solve it?

## Better

> Jim, the gamer, wants a green icon
> when the battery is > 20% and a red
> icon when the battery is <= 20%,
> so he doesn't kill his phone and miss calls.

## Better

> Jim, the gamer, wants a green icon
> when the battery is > 20% and a red
> icon when the battery is <= 20%,
> so he doesn't kill his phone and miss calls.

But can we deliver less, faster?

---

## Smaller

> Jim, the gamer,
> wants to know what percentage of his battery is left,
> so he doesn't kill his phone and miss calls.

> Jim, the gamer,

> saving him some time and effort.
